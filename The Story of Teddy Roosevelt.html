                Teddy joined Harvard College in the late 19th century, eager to pursue his interests like everyone else. But he wasn't just an everyday Harvard student, he was an extremely energetic fellow with interests ranging from boxing, wrestling, body building to dancing, poetry and even writing. In fact, by the summer of his freshman year, he had written a book called The Summer Birds of the Adirondacks which was well received by the Bulletin and the public. 
<p>
                Teddy juggled all these extracurricular activities while staying on top of all his classes; he managed to complete five of his seven courses in his freshman year with honors .. AT HARVARD! Further probing into his life revealed that he spent only a small amount of time studying. To achieve this level of competency Teddy incorporated the law of productivity into his life. The law is defined as follows:
            </p>              
                 High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)
                 <p>               
                This law states that with enough concentration, you can complete a deep task which would normally take a day in just a few hours. The more intensity the less time spent. This kind of commitment requires no contact with any distracting thoughts or objects (like your phone). The future president, Teddy Roosevelt, tackled all of his responsibilities and still had time to hang out with his friends afterwards. 
            </p>               
                This kind of deep work is to yearn for, and can only be achieved through practice. So, maybe start by doing a few hours of high-intensity work and get accustomed to it. Once you are confident with your focus levels increase the frequency of these pockets of productivity.
