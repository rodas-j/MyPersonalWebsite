            <td>Book Review: Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport
 <p>
                This book is the third book of Cal Newport's I'm reviewing in this channel. There's a compelling reason that makes Cal's books stand out, at least to me.  When it comes to self-improvement principles and philosophies, we are wired to adopt ideas coined by experts in their fields like Marcus Aurelius, an ancient emperor and philosopher or Jordan Peterson, a clinical psychologist and a professor at the University of Toronto. Cal Newport is a computer scientist and an associate professor at Georgetown University, far unrelated to the field of self-development than what you might expect. Productivity is a hobby (an interest) to him. Not only does he avoid, highly abstract and vague thinking in his books, he also describes how these habits affected his professional life, and the proposals are relatable enough that we can quickly adapt to our own lives. That's why books like these will undoubtedly resonate with you.
            </p>              
                That said, this book is, at best, up to standard but still unflattering. Why? Because Cal Newport isn't the first to warn us about the destructive force of social media, and he won't be the last. Since the rise of smartphones in the late 2010s, the detrimental effects of social media have been subtle, but now everyone is aware of how possessed they are by their phones. You can find many appalling facts if you do a quick search on the internet. Did you know the average person spends 3 hours on her phone every day? And many more articles and videos are telling you how to rid yourself of these 'conquerors.' Then why does Cal Newport's book exist? Well, this goes along with all self-help books: Books like this are there to remind you and motivate you. After reading this book, you can expect yourself to receive a boost of motivation, ready to quit social media, or at least go without it for a few weeks.
                <p>                 
                There are different solutions outlined for this modern-age problem as it's the case for many other books. But what makes Digital Minimalism shine among others is the principle mentioned in this book: the principles of digital minimalism. Contrary to the hard-locked approach proposed in Deep Work, which is to quit social media altogether, Cal concedes that social media is the backbone of some successful ventures, and he suggests, instead, a different, more lenient approach. In digital minimalism, you only adopt the technologies in which the benefits exceedingly outweigh the cost â€” the cost being distraction. But to do that, you must first go through a prolonged detox to clear your head and make logical decisions.

            <h2>              
                30-Day Restraint</h2>
            </p>             
                You must disentangle yourself from every internet-connected device and only retain those that are extremely important to your health, career, or relationship. This action is to ensure that you experience the full benefit of the off-time you get from disengaging from social media. During this time, you resort to high-intensity leisure activities to fill up your time. For instance, you make planned visits with friends, go hiking, swimming, etc. When returning from this long period of peace, you make mindful decisions on which components of social media to incorporate back into your life.
                <p>                
                Aside from the solution mentioned above, Cal adds other new and exciting suggestions to consider as you redefine your relationship with your phone and social media. These include spending time in solitude to reflect on thoughts, taking long walks, and even journaling.
            </p>            
                All in all, the arguments presented in this book are certainly enticing, but they are far from extraordinary. I don't blame the author, however. Cal Newport is one of those people who refused to create a Facebook account back when Facebook first began out of spite for Mark Zuckerburg's success, so he can't relate to the struggles we face. Nevertheless, he presented compelling research and conveyed his ideas eloquently. With that said, I leave you with one question: imagine yourself well into your 50s or 60s, can you see yourself engaging with your phone as much as you do now?
