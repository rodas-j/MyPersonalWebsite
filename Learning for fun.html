                It's summertime, and if you are a student, you will probably spend your time catching up with friends, visiting distant families, going on a vacation, and maybe—quite possibly—learning? All our lives, we were taught to believe that learning is done either to catch up or get ahead in school. In this article, I raise the notion that learning isn't burdensome; we should learn because it's fun.
 <p>
For a lot of people learning is associated with pain, and the only good thing that comes from spending nine months in schools is to cultivate good friendships. Formal education has destroyed our innate drive for knowledge. Growing up, we are taught that all the learning we do is for an external cause. For instance, we learn to get a degree, get a job, and, ultimately, have a stable life. The raw, untethered definition of learning, however, is much more profound. Have you ever experienced the euphoria that fills your body when you finally understand a concept from a subject you adore? That's how it should feel. By learning, we add dimensions to our perspectives, sharpen our understanding, feed our desire for knowledge, and so on.
 </p>
Devoting time for independent study can seem daunting, especially in the summer. I understand that some of my subscribers are in their twenties and thirties, and they might claim that learning for leisure is a luxury only afforded by people with time. When work is on the way, we can't think of anything but work. However, keep in mind that you have 168 hours in a week, and besides working hours, a large portion of this time is spent scrolling through social media feeds—I will boldly claim because I do it. And since you are browsing telegram at the moment, chances are you also have ample time. By setting aside as little as ten minutes every day to grow and challenge yourself through learning, you can go a long way.

Is all the learning done for fun useful? 
 </p>
If you look at this historically, Albert Einstein—during his miracle year when he published four groundbreaking research papers—was working a job at a Swiss patent office as a civil servant. At the time, physics was a mere hobby for Einstein, and he dedicated a small portion of his time every day for it. Similarly, and on a hypothetical basis, we demonstrate this idea using a computer science student. These days, earning a degree with the highest honor is simply not enough to attract employers. Instead, employers give precedence to those that have managed to complete a project or build something independently. These potential employees will know how to, in colloquial terms, "think outside the box." The best way to get ahead in this demanding era is to have a personal interest and build on it.

How to adopt this principle
 </p>
Even if you are willing to embrace this principle, it's impossible to apply it overnight. How, then? 

Will Smith, in his interview with Charlie Rose, said, "You can't build the biggest wall overnight, but you can lay one brick one day at a time." If you decide to learn five new words every day, in a week, you will have learned thirty-five new words. In a month, with 150 words, you'll be unstoppable. Similarly, reading daily, for an hour, will allow you to cover roughly fifty books in a year. That's more than what most of us read in our lifetime. It won't be easy; building a habit requires dedication and commitment. But it can be done.
