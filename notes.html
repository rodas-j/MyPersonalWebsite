               <p> Although I'm still an amateur bookworm, I have long been an advocate of reading books. The benefits are clear to everyone, of course. If you're not familiar with them, you can search the web to find thousands of articles raving about their benefits. For me, the most important pillar of reading is learning new things. That being said, I asked myself how much do I spend time reading and I did some digging.

            <p>This book is the third book of Cal Newport's I'm reviewing in this channel. There's a compelling reason that makes Cal's books stand out, at least to me.</p>

        </h2>
            <p>Since Flow has different insights and wide-ranging perspectives, it's almost impossible to cover everything in a short article. So, instead of writing an exhaustive review of the book, I will raise important details and focus more on my perception of the book. For a thorough summary of the book, please follow this link.
