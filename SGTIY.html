            <td>Book Review: So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport
<p>
                This book was written as a guide for ambitious individuals who want to understand the passion hypothesis and end up doing the job they love. It talks about how students can navigate through their career and land the work they will enjoy. Cal tries to narrow these steps to four rules that should apply to all fields. He puts it as follows:
            </p>    <p>          
                Rule #1
                Rule one is, ironically, not to follow your passion. Cal tries to make a claim that we aren't born with innate passions which we will eventually discover. If we believe in the passion hypothesis we will 
                inadvertently be caught in the rabbit hole of dissatisfaction; if Steve Jobs, creator of Apple, had decided to follow his passion, he would have become a spiritual Zen on the way to enlightenment. Never would he have ventured into the tech world and became the CEO of Apple. 
            </p>     <p>       
                Rule #2
                You might ask, if passion is non-existent, then how can we end up with a satisfying career. What can we do? Cal tackles this issue by introducing the concept of So Good They Can't Ignore You: you can be the best at what you do, and enjoy the work you do as a result. Cal raises the idea of Career Capital as one of the most necessary things to acquire before pursuing a career. To better illustrate the idea, imagine a 4th year med student who adamantly believes that her passion was never to become a doctor. She drops out with so much courage and decides to invest all her money and become a Yoga instructor. She loved Yoga, but she made a deadly move by giving up her career as a doctor. Now she is competing with other professionals who had 10 years more experience than her. She ultimately fails because she doesn't have a career capital: the prior experience she needed to succeed in the field. Had she stayed a doctor, she would have 4 years of medical education to work with.  
            </p>  <p>         
                Rule #3 
                Rule three talks about the importance of control. Whatever your job may be, be your own boss. Definitive researches show control over your work guarantees happiness and leads you towards the work you love. Granted, promotion means more money but it also means more work and less control so you should avoid it at all cost. Instead, worry about engaging your career capital with more freedom. Do you want to end up being a Porche-driving, ulcer-suffering VP? 
            </p>    <p>      
                Rule #4
                Missionâ€¦ Or purpose. Whatever you may call it. Is the end of the road. When you have reached the cutting-edge of your career. As a bio researcher your mission can be to cure Ebola. As a renowned lawyer your mission can be to become the next president. Whatever your mission is, do it when you reach the frontier of your field not before.
