                I didn't start reading this book with the intent of writing a review for it, so I hadn't prepared any notes. But I knew I would regret not raving about Shoe Dog. This book was so much more than a good read. It left a lasting impression on me.
            </p>  
                Phil, an ordinary guy from an ordinary family, decided one day to LIVE. He embarked on a journey across the world. He went to India, on the streets of Bombay; to Cairo, at the foot of the Great Sphinx; Jerusalem, to the rock where Abraham prepared to kill his son. He was a traveler. But what set him aside was a vision for the world. Phil took to his heart the notion of leaving a mark on this world, not through a mediocre job at Price Waterhouse, which he quit immediately, but through a "Crazy Idea": running shoes, a brainchild of his which later turned into the famous NIKE brand.
                <p>                
                Running wasn't a norm back then. "Get a Horse!" people would yell to runners passing by. Phil's passion for running came from his track race experience in Cleveland High School. "Let everyone else call your idea crazy.. just keep going. Don't stop. Don't even think about stopping until you get there, and don't give much thought to where "there" is. Whatever comes, just don't stop." From the $50 his father grudgingly gave him, Phil built an empire where everyone could enjoy a small jog. Jogging is a commodity because of him. 
            </p>   
                Admittedly, it was hard, and Phil's courage was awe-inspiring. Throughout his journey, Phil juggled through leading his obsessive, quirky, and loyal sales team, living with his wife and two kids on a slime budget, and enduring the crushing fear of imprisonment from lawsuits and impending bankruptcy. He reveals, humorously, that it was a hard path, and he was partially able to overcome all the stress through his 6-mile meditative jog every evening, which helped him stay in shape and outlive all his friends -- he is 81 now.

                The main takeaways from this book: <br>
            </p>  <p>  
                1. No scale of "good idea" can bypass all the hardship it takes to make something of it. <br> 
            </p>    <p>
                2. The idea of selling products is not reserved for extroverts. Phil was among the most introverted people, yet he managed to make $8000 in sales in his first year, which amounted to a lot back then. He did it going from door to door. <br>
            </p>    
                3. Money was never and will never be the primary goal. Phil didn't pay himself wage even after his company was receiving enormous profit margins. He poured all his money from his full-time job to his company. The reward he got was from the satisfaction of his customers, the success of his brand, and the proud face of his demanding father.
                    <p>    
                    Decades after his launch, Phil reflects one evening, when we stumbled upon Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, how he had climbed the same ladder as them but was worth six times less than both of them. He asserts that it was never about the money.
                </p>    
                    <p>
                    4. Mission comes after knowledge. As Cal Newport put it in his book "So Good They Can't Ignore You," groundbreaking ideas sprout from the cutting edge (the frontier) of one's academic field. Phil Knight stumbled on the business strategy of importing cheap and high-quality Japanese shoes from his thesis at Stanford University Graduate School. He would never have come across his Crazy Idea without his academic and life experiences.
                </p>  
                Shoe Dog is yet another epitome of great memoirs -- you get to live in the shoes of a shoe seller. Reliving the extraordinary events of the world through the eyes of someone you look up to. You pull up a picture of the 1972 5000m Olympic Final and say, "Phil was standing right there, cheering with the crowd, at Steve Prefontaine's monumental win."
