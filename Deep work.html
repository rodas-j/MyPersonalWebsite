                Book Review: Deep Work by Cal Newport
<p>
The concept of deep work stems from the idea that the new economy -- the one we live by -- demands high-skill workers to work deeply and deliberately to succeed. So, basically there are many ways to be successful in this world and sometimes it all comes down to luck, but Cal guarantees that one of the surest way to be successful is to apply the deep work principles he outlines in his book Deep Work.
</p>
He starts the book by introducing the concept of deep work. He puts it as follows: 
<p>
Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
</p><p>
The book goes on to convince readers about the rarity, value and meaningfulness of deep work and it guarantees rewards for those who to commit to this new way of life. At this point the author talks about the examples of deep work in real life by taking the tech entrepreneur Bill Gates himself as an example. Bill Gates is famous for his "Think Weeks" where he sets aside several weeks of isolation in a year to catch up on world affairs through reading books and articles in deep concentration. Some people say it is in one of these "Think Weeks" that Bill Gates had his aha-moment with Microsoft and its global empire.  
</p>
Cal discusses other influential public figures to further solidify the value of deep work before he talks about the practical approach to embracing deep work. At this point, if you are ready to make deep work part of your life, then you are ready to abide by the four rules the author outlines for the principle:
<p>
Rule #1 Work Deeply
	Here the author talks about the setting for deep work. You can start by organizing your work space to make it easier to concentrate and do meaningful work (I'll dive more into this in another post.) You must also understand that the desire to stop working and do something else fun is often the norm and not the exception. Research shows we are likely to be raided by thoughts of eating, sleeping, checking emails or watching movies while doing work. Finally, Cal discusses the philosophies behind depth. In other words, you can either choose something like a "Think Week" to invest in or maybe an hour of deep work every day which is more convenient for many people. 
</p><p>	
Rule #2 Embrace Boredom
	… because boredom sparks creativity. Researches have concluded that boredom (or lack of useless engagements like social media or watching movies) can be the main engine for creativity. This is because companies like Facebook and Telegram trade your attention and data in exchange for money. When you are away from these "network tools" you become bored, and your mind will be free to engage in deep thoughts.
	
	To actually control your addiction to social media, you must learn to take breaks from your focus as opposed to taking breaks from social media. This might seem counterintuitive but it makes sense because if you can control when you open social media you can learn to resist the urge to constantly take a look at your feeds. So you won't necessarily starve from lack of social media but you can take control of your use.
</p>	
Rule #3 Quit Social Media
	… or you can just quit social media altogether. At this point in the book, Cal urges us to ask ourselves "why do I use social media?" Most of us can list out some really interesting insights to this question, but the author argues that whatever our excuses are they aren't necessarily enough. He calls these excuses the any-benefit mindset: if you can find one benefit to social media, then you should definitely use it. Cal argues that when we make decisions that would drastically affect our deep work habits, we should take the time to really evaluate these tools. (social media and others) The author then talks in-depth about the practical ways in which we can realize the importance of social media in our lives and decide if we should quit social media. 
	<p>
Rule #4 Drain the Shallows
	The opposite of Deep Work is Shallow Work. 
</p>	
	Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
	
	This kind of work can be responding to typical emails or doing house chores. Sometimes work like this is necessary, at least for the short term. However, Cal argues that by finding ways to avoid these tasks will ultimately benefit out deep work habits.
