                We are at the shift in our lives where playing games and watching movies all day isn't as satisfying as it used to be. Admittedly, people of all ages and experiences will agree that summer is meant for rest, but it's hard to define rest. It can't mean sitting all day watching movies, surely! It may be spending quality time with friends, or, as I attempt to convey in this article, diving into productive habits. 
            </p>
                Summer is a time to supplement your goals and gain the experiences you wouldn't have otherwise acquired during the school year. It could also be a time to explore your interests and determine what you ultimately want to do with your life. In this article, I want to share a few tips I dug up.
                <h2>
            Summer Cleaning (Maintenance Season)
                </h2>
Summer is the only suitable time to press the reset button. You may want to redecorate, shift some furniture around to make your room feel homey; declutter, get rid of clothes you don't wear and textbooks you'll never use; or digitize paperwork and notes. Knowing that your environment is as you intended it to be will give you peace of mind and clarity.  It will boost your spirit that will last throughout the summer. 
<h2>
Learn new things
</h2>
Just thinking about escaping to the summer to be confronted by a bunch of study requirements gags some people, and it's understandable. However, learning can be fun and refreshing -- bear with me. Learning in this sense means discovering/creating new things under a desirable setting, where you get to choose what to do and when to do it. It may be learning to ride a bike, to write poems, or to type faster. I will dedicate an entire article on this issue soon: if done the right way, learning can be entertaining. 
<h2>
Build a new habit
</h2>
In a controlled environment with no external stress or obligation, building a new habit is relatively easy. And there's no better time to do it than the summer. To learn more about this idea, check out my article about habits.
<h2>
Tackle a Project
</h2>
A summer project is an extensive activity that spans the entire summer. It can be a challenge like running a half-marathon or reading ten books. It could be an academic interest like taking a language lesson or a personal engagement like writing a short novel for Wattpad or joining the gym. These activities need enormous dedication, and since it's the summer, you have no school responsibilities to hinder you from completing them.
<p>
Tackling a project is the most important commitment from the ones I mentioned. This project will be highlighted on your resume, reflected in your behavior, and it will ultimately bring you the most satisfaction. When you look back, you will say, "In the summer of '19, I did this amazing thing for myself!"
