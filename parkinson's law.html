                <p>Imagine you have an exam due in a week. The reading you're required to cover is 20 pages long. It's reasonable to assume that hard-working people would start preparing a week or perhaps five days in advance. In contrast, procrastinators would put off the work until the last day. Ultimately, however, both parties would have completed the reading material before the exam. Hence, in retrospect, the procrastinators were arguably more productive as they didnâ€™t waste four more days. Granted, they may have spent that time "slacking off", but four days would be recovered nonetheless. This observation is demonstrated by Parkinson's Law, first coined by Cyril Northcote Parkinson. The law states:
                </p>
                <p>
                    work expands to fill the time available for its completion
                </p>     
                    A perfect analogy would be air in a room: the air would expand/compress to fill the room in every case. Admittedly, many parameters govern this observation -- the quality of the work and inclusivity, to name a few -- but the law is just that, an observation.
                <p>     
                    The hard workers may have read for the entire five days but at a slow pace and a less stressful environment. It seems counterproductive when inspecting the number of hours they devoted to such small work. They weren't willing to push themselves and work under a time constraint. They failed to understand that productivity is all about what you accomplish, not how often you work.
                </p>    
                    The main takeaway is that we should practice working in limiting circumstances. Devoting an entire summer for a particular project instead of enjoying the summer altogether is a deal-breaker for most people, and it's the reason why they don't take on projects. But once they understand that their work is compressible, they can fit so much more into their schedule even fun activities.
