                In this article, I intend to address the details of morning routines/rituals as part of my "Waking Up Early" endeavor. This article will tackle the question that comes to everyone's minds when they wake up early: What should I do now?
                <p>
                For a morning person, morning routines/rituals are the foundations for a productive day. Richard Whately put it best when he said: "Lose an hour in the morning, and you will spend all day looking for it." These routines are comprised of activities practiced every day during the morning, activities ranging from something as minor as making your bed to something intense as going out for a jog or working on a book you're writing. 
            </p>
                Some benefits of morning routines are subtle while others are vivid in our daily lives. Depending on our goals and the components of our morning routines, we could witness drastic improvements in our lives -- spikes in our energy levels when we exercise daily, for example -- or we will observe small incremental progress towards our long-term goals. In addition, these incredible routines will give us the momentum we need to conquer the rest of the day. Morning activities can be reading a book, taking a morning stroll, listening to podcasts, building a specific skill (playing the guitar, for example,) exercising and more. We can choose multiple tasks, or even one, to fill out our morning hours. With the tremendous energy boost we get in the morning, we can complete a lot of cognitively-demanding tasks. 
                <p>
                During my experiment, I employed some routines tailored to my goals and aspirations. So, basically, I would wake up around six in the morning and have a glass of water; Make my bed, and meditate for a couple of minutes. I would then read for about an hour before making a plan for the day.  On the spectrum of complicated routines, this is nowhere near the cutting edge, but it's useful to my current goals. 
            </p>
                I'm sure most of my subscribers are very ambitious people in general. Judging from the polls I posted a while ago, a lot of you wake up on early hours so most of you will be keen to try these rituals on your own. To establish a solid and effective morning routine, you must understand some key points. 
                <p>
                1. Don't feel down if you couldn't achieve it at first. It will take time and effort to make it a habit. I suggest you start slow, with only a few important activities in the morning before you broaden your routines. 
            </p>   
                2. No matter how ambitious you are, these routines will often prove to be tedious and uninspiring. So make sure you put one or two activities you genuinely love doing in your routines to force yourself out of bed every day.
