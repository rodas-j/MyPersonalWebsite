                On today's article, we will be focusing on breaking habits, particularly breaking the habit of overeating. 
<p>
                Is it just me or do you find yourself glued to your laptop watching a movie and eating at the same time? You're so focused on the movie that all of a sudden you realize you went through your meal feeling unsatisfied so you add more. In retrospect, I feel like I eat 6 meals worth of food each day just because I don't feel satisfied after a meal.  It's easy to undermine this observation, but if you are on a hardcore diet this is not something you can afford to do. 
            </p>
                Thankfully, there's a solution to this predicament. In his book Productivity Project, Chris Bailey mentions two key habits he used to scrub off the last 3% body fat that prevented him from achieving his fitness goal. Like I've claimed in my article, Habits can't be broken, rather they are overshadowed (replaced) by other more pronounced and rewarding habits. And Chris's two effective habits are paramount when it comes to weight loss and overeating. The two habits are as follows:
                <p>
                1. Mindful Eating: When the meal is served, stop whatever you are engaged in and give full attention to what you're eating. That means no watching tv or browsing social media. Instead, focus on the crunchy, moisty sensation the food leaves in your mouth. You'll learn to appreciate the meal served to you and become more satisfied. 
            </p>  
                2. Stop Eating If You Notice You're Full: I know this is a bold statement especially in our tradition where leaving a plate unfinished is frowned upon. That being said, building the courage needed to up and leave when you notice that you're full goes beyond overeating. It's self-discipline.
