                Book Review: Flow: the psychology of optimal experiences by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced Me-high cheek-sent-me-high)
<p>
Since Flow has different insights and wide-ranging perspectives, it's almost impossible to cover everything in a short article. So, instead of writing an exhaustive review of the book, I will raise important details and focus more on my perception of the book. For a thorough summary of the book, please follow this link. 
</p>
What is Flow?
<p></p>
Flow, as the name suggests, is a state. A state in which one's mind and body are completely aligned with the task at hand. When a person is completely focused at something that is mentally and physically demanding, striving to achieve a particular goal, she is experiencing flow, the optimal experience. It's the sum of these flow experiences that prove to a person on her deathbed that her life was meaningful. Initially, the concept was overwhelming to me. It forced me to reimagine how people find happiness in what they do. The book sheds light on the fact that the meaning of life comes from meaningful experiences induced by Flow. To understand Flow, Mihaly, the author, along with many other researchers at the time undertook a mass survey using a method called the Experience Sampling Method. So they basically gave a lot of people a pager that reminds them at a random interval to record what they were doing and how they felt at that moment. The result of this study suggested that people are feeling happy almost exclusively when they are engaged in an activity that requires intense concentration and a unique set of skills to achieve a certain goal. This may be playing the piano, reading, hiking, or participating in a competitive sport. This conclusion led to the birth of Flow.

How to Flow
<p>
There are tangible signs to know when you are experiencing flow. According to Mihaly, these are the times when you feel extreme joy in life. That being said, you should know that the following signs are not restricted to work, they can be experienced in other leisure activities:
</p><p>
    1. You lose track of time: Hours will have passed by within minutes or vice versa. When reading an interesting book, you will find yourself hooked with the flow of the words. Your eyes will glide through the pages in perfect harmony with the rhythmic click of time. Hours will fly by and you'll only notice this after you finish the task at hand.
    2. You are focused: When you enter the flow state, you let go of all the revolving thoughts and the stress that comes with them. Your insecurities will drown and every urgent issue will be swept away from your consciousness. You will feel at ease.
    3. There's a clear outcome: The activity you are engaged in will have small attainable goals with their own rewards. These goals are the ones that will drive you forward no matter how dull the activity might seem. 
</p>
Flow Experiences
<p>
The book broadly touches every aspect of everyone's lives. From the prisoners of Nazi to the outcasts living solitude, to industry workers at the heart of Detroit, to the royalties of ancient Rome, to the famine-struck regions. The book also analyzes the forces of nature such as old age, religion, and even the cosmos. The book examines all these phenomena and successfully interprets them in the language of flow. In this review, I will mention some of the interpretations that stood out to me.
</p>
About the Universe (Proactivity and Reactivity)
<p>
Mihaly starts off by saying, "The universe was never designed with the comfort of human beings in mind." Contrary to what we might believe, Earth, as beautiful as it is, was never completely suitable for humans to live in. Let the long stretches of deserts and the tremors of earthquakes speak for themselves. We must understand that despite every good or bad fortune that knocks our doors, the Universe will always remain neutral. Therefore, the way we respond to adversities will largely determine our overall happiness. This idea leads us to the terms Proactivity and Reactivity. For the sake of coherence, I will first define Reactivity.
</p>
Reactive Personality: Reactive people will yield to the fate that befalls them. They believe that no good can come from the adversities that they encounter. At least they have the world to blame only because they don't understand that the universe is random.
<p>
Proactive Personality: Proactive people are largely different from Reactive people on how they choose to respond to adversities. They understand that Mother Nature is unforgiving at times. They choose to take responsibility and find something fruitful from their experiences.

I won't tell you which one you should be because at this point it's obvious. Kennedy uttered it best when he said, "ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."

Don't Follow the Mass.

Leisure Activities
What to do when the power is out.
<p>
Often times, especially when there's no light, I find myself engaged in an interesting game of ping pong against my bedroom wall. My phone is dead and so is my Laptop (freeing me from any homework I may have.) At this moment, isolated from my phone and social media, I'm at the mercy of the restless thoughts battering my head. This entropy is what creates boredom. To restore order to my mind and get out of this boredom, I practice a Flow activity. For me, that's playing a mindful game of ping pong against my wall. In time, however, I get bored because I had learned enough to play back and forth with ease. I stop concentrating on the game and my head slowly drifts. I start yearning for some electronic entertainment which only ever managed to provide a temporary fix. That's when I decide to up the challenge. I started playing with my left hand which gave me a whole new challenge and a jolt of excitement. I would feel a sense of achievement whenever I could maintain a good rhythm. Not only is this activity giving order to my mind, but it is also helping me realize that learning new skills can be rewarding and enjoyable.

It might sound counterintuitive and even flat out weird to some of you at first but this simple hack is what kept Nelson Mandela and many others like him sane through decades of imprisonment. Any mentally demanding task, be it chess, reciting texts and poems, reading books or even adding numbers, will eliminate every trace of boredom you might feel. Our phones are notorious for their small fulfilling injections of dopamine creating the filling of happiness while secretly working our life towards prolonged boredom and depression. This concerning issue is further discussed in Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism which I plan to read later this year.
